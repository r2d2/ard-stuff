# Foreword
This project is about saving my findings building my own sensors for my domoticz station.
Here is I currently have in mind :
- [x] *ard-dht* : a temperature/humidity sensor
- [ ] *ard-power* : a power consumption sensor

***
# *ard-dht*
## BOM : 
* Arduino
* DHT11 or DHT22 sensor
* 433Mhz emitter module

## Hardware :
* Arduino Digital 3 : sensor data pin 
* Arduino Digital 4 : RF emitter data pin
* Arduino Digital 13 : led pin (optional)
* [schematics] https://github.com/r2d2/ard-stuff/blob/master/ard-dht/hw/ard-dht.pdf
